# Aptogotchi (Beginner)
Aptogotchi is a simple and fun full-stack, end-to-end dApp demonstrating the basics of how to build a dApp using Move. 

We introduce the following concepts:
1. how to create a full-stack dApp 
2. how to connect to smart contracts on the Aptos blockchain
2. how to integrate with Petra Wallet/Explorer/ANS and other services.
2. how to create events and use indexer to get off-chain data.
3. how to write unit tests for the smart contracts.

This dApp will be used as an educational demo hosted on [Aptos Learn](https://learn.aptoslabs.com/).

You can find more instructions about the Move contract in move/README.md.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
cd frontend
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
